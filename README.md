# remit-track
Interface/Starter code for collecting exchange data from public APIs of popular Consumer FX apps offering NGN (Nigerian Naira) Inbound or Outbound. 

The original goal was to build a python package but accounting for all shapes of json returned by the APIs can be very tricky.

# Current Status
- I am standardising the starter code to fully work for the following apps:
  - Send by Flutterwave
  - Afriex
  - Instarem
  - Nala
  - Profee
  - Remitly
  - SendSprint
  - Sendwave
  - TransferGo
  - Wise

- Things to do
  - [ ] Universal class for starter code
  - [ ] Methods for Universal class
  - [ ] Publish formatting for universal class base_url and payload (for API Requests)
  - [ ] Documentation for using starter code (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w8BFq7iNh1417s1b9dJaEF9hTkjmw2TReRG_kyNDT4g/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
